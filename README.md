# var0xshell

* var0xshell is shell based on clent and server 
* Both client and server was written in python 3
* It uses XOR alogrithms for encrypted communication

* Attacker create a socket to connect to victim on (IP - Port)
* Attacker receive the key from victim. 
* Attacker encrypt the command and send it to the victim. 
* The Victim decrypt the encrypted command execute it and send the output encrypted to attacker which decrypt the output and print it. 
* For less detection we can convert the code to revers shell
